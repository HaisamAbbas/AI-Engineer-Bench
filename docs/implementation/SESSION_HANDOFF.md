# Session handoff

Updated: 2026-09-14
Completed phase: Prompts 08-09 — ENG-010 task breadth and ENG-011 analysis; ENG-012 prepared

## Current state

ENG-010 is complete locally. EXT-02 (`ext.batch-alignment`) is a runnable HTTP extraction application with a deliberately broken positional mapping baseline. Its evaluator uses shuffled output, partial failure, and last-occurrence-wins repeated IDs to verify correspondence and retention. TOOL-01 (`tool.false-completion`) is a runnable HTTP workflow application with a deliberately dishonest completion baseline. Its evaluator owns an independent operation service and ledger; candidate logs do not decide outcomes. Both task families have public API/requirements, visible data, baseline/reference/alternative/shortcuts, provenance, maintainer-only fixtures, ten-reset controls, and pass through the CLI fresh replay path.

ENG-011 is complete locally. `aieb-analysis` is the authoritative metric implementation for per-task s/n, Wilson intervals, repeatability, complete-plan eligibility, cost-per-resolution unknown/zero-success behavior, time/deadline/attrition metrics, and project/family limitations.

ENG-012 is prepared but blocked. `examples/development-pilot-18.json` freezes an offline 3 task x 2 deterministic fixture entrant x 3 repetition matrix. It was not executed as a real pilot because no provider/cloud authorization, credentials, approved cap, or fixed real-agent configuration exists. It is not presented as a campaign result.

No real agent, paid provider, hosted service, deployment, publication, commit, or push occurred in this phase. Existing independent-review, ENG-001 real-agent, and ENG-019 official-isolation gates remain pending/blocked.

## Commands

```

## Continuing working rules

- Implement only the requested phase and its necessary prerequisites.
- Inspect before editing.
- Tests must exercise behavior.
- Preserve immutable benchmark evidence.
- Never invent scores or present mocks as live evaluations.
- Never weaken hidden-evaluator isolation, scoring, or reproducibility to make a demo pass.
- Local reversible work should proceed without repeated confirmations.
- Use already-authorized budgets only.
- Track blocked gates honestly.
- Do not automatically commit, push, deploy, or publish unless authorized.
- When commits are requested, use separate role-specific commits rather than bundling unrelated phases.

## Recommended next prompt

Implement Prompt 10 / ENG-013 only after resolving pilot findings or explicitly deciding what authoring may proceed while ENG-012 remains unexecuted. Do not claim an official campaign or expand hosted scope.
